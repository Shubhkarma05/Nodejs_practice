fs.copyFile(src, dest[, mode], callback)#
History
src <string> | <Buffer> | <URL> source filename to copy
dest <string> | <Buffer> | <URL> destination filename of the copy operation
mode <integer> modifiers for copy operation. Default: 0.
callback <Function>
err <Error>
Asynchronously copies src to dest. By default, dest is overwritten if it already exists. No arguments other than a possible exception are given to the callback function. Node.js makes no guarantees about the atomicity of the copy operation. If an error occurs after the destination file has been opened for writing, Node.js will attempt to remove the destination.
